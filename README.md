# Name
Hi, I am 박성렬(朴成烈) from South Korea. For those who can't understand Korean or the Chinese letters, I use the romanized version of my name on the web; Park Sungryeol. It's [pak̚s̕ʌŋɲyʌl] in IPA. If it's too difficult to pronounce, you can just call me Max(or Maxwell).

# Specialty
I've been working as a frontend web engineer. These are the toolsets frequently used for my projects:

 - Javascript/Typescript/Node.js
 - Go
 - Python
 - Rust
 - 📚 Data visualization: D3.js
 - 🧶 Web Crawling: Puppeteer.js, Beautifulsoup...
 - 👀 Vue.js/React.js/Next.js/Nuxt.js
 - 🛠 Docker/k8/git/Nginx/Traefik

Just like other github users, this is not my work account; some commits are omitted from my code commit table.
